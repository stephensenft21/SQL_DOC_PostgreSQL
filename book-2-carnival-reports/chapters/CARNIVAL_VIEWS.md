# Converting Your Practice Queries into Views

It's time to convert some of your report queries into views so that other database developers, and application developers can quickly gain access to useful reports without having to write their own SQL.

1. Review all of the queries that you wrote for chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11.
1. Determine which of those views you feel would be most useful over time. Consider the view itself, or how it could be integrated into another query and/or view.
1. If there were several software applications written that access this database _(e.g. HR applications, sales/tax applications, online purchasing applications, etc.)_, which, if any of your queries should be converted into views that multiple applications would like use?

Be prepared to discuss, and defend your choices in the next class.

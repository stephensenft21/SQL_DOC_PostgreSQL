# Building the Carnival Entity Relationship Diagram

Now itâ€™s time for you to design the database for Carnival. With your teammates, use Lucidchart to create the ERD for a normalized relational database for the Carnival Data. Be prepared to discuss your ERD in class. 

## Goal

 - Build an ERD for a 3NF relational database. 
 - Be sure to identify all primary keys and foreign keys.
 - All relationship cardinalities must be represented using the appropriate symbols.
 - The data type of each field must be clearly defined.

## Getting Started   

1. Go to [Lucidchart Templates](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents#/templates?folder_id=home&browser=icon) and search for `ERD`.
2. Click `Open Template` for the template named `Database ER diagram (crow's foot)` to get started.
3. Be sure to click the `Share` button in the top right corner and share your ERD with your instructors.
